	<br>Items I would choose:
	  <ol>
	    <li>1 Magnetic Compass</li>
		<li>15 Gallons of water</li>
		<li>55 Mini bags of peanuts</li>
		<li>3 Airplane blankets</li>
		<li>1 First aid kit</li>
	  </ol>
	 </p>
	<p style="color: #FFFFFF">My Solution:
	<br>In this situation, I would use the compass to walk in the direction of the nearest city or settlement. On the journey towards the nearest city, I would be sure to cober my skin with the airplane blankets in order to avoid sun poisoning/sunburn. On our journey, we would survive on the 15 gallons of water and 55 bags of peanuts. In case of emergency/injury, I would be sure to keep the salvaged first aid kit on hand.
